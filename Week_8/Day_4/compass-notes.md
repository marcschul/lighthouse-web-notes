### DOM - Document Object Model
  * Structure - Tree with nodes
  * Parents and Children
  * Not language specific
  * Apps do not listen to events unless told too.
  * To set up your app to respond to events:
    * Add an event listener to a DOM node
    * Specify which event it should listen for
    * Add a function that runs when that event happens
  * Event listeners create an event object
### JQuery
### 3 Main browser objects
  * window
  * navigator
  * document
  * Navigator -> Window -> Document -> head / body ->
  * Use dev tools console, `navigator`, `window`, `document`

  1. Using <br> and space-between for the "write a new tweet"
  // use padding, adjust manually
  2. Using a div
