## Class Inheritance
  * A technique in OOP to reduce duplicate code
  * Builds a new class based on an existing class.
  * The `extends` keyword is used in class declarations or class expressions to create a class that is a child of another class.
    * subclass is the child
    * superclass is the parent
  ``` JS 
  class subclass extends superclass {
  // ... code here
  }
  ```
