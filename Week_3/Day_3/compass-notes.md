# Compass Notes
*August 4th, 2021*
## TDD
  * Modules vs Libraries vs Packages
    * Library is a collection of code stored in a single file (can also be called packaged library)
    * Packages is a library, that can be stored in a single file or multiple files
    * Modules are ... ?
  * Javascript's `require` method
## Mocha and Chai
  * Mocha's `describe` Function
  * Mocha's `it` Function
  * Chai's `assert` ... ?
  ``` JS
  const chai = require('chai');
  const assert = chai.assert;
  ```
  * exports fn
  ``` JS
  module.exports = myFuncName
  ```
  * importing library to a JS File
  ```JS
  const library = require('library');
  ```
  * Javascript `module` object
