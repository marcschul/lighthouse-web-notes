# Object Oriented Programming - OOP

4 Pillars to OOP
==
The 4 pillars to OOP is Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation

* Abstraction - hides all but the relevant data about an object in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency
* Polymorphism - something occurs in several different forms, for example. A Parent class may have a fn `hello()` and the child class may also have a fn `hello()`. In this case, only one of the classes will be defined, often the child but not necessary
* Inheritance -  one class inherits the attributes and methods of another class
* Encapsulation - idea of bundling attributes and methods that work on that class within it's instance. As compared to procedural programming, where variables and functions are separate.
