### Ajax - Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
  * "async" refers to the fact that Ajax HTTP requests don't interrupt a user's interaction with the current web page
  * Ajax is used to get data from web servers into Strings in JavaScript
  * data is transferred as JSON Strings so that they can be easily converted into JavaScript Objects.
  * jQuery will do the String to Object conversion for you if it can tell that the data is JSON.
  * What you do with those Strings and Objects is up to you. Use your imagination!
