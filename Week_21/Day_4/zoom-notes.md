## Javascript Classes
  * classes are blueprints for create objects
  * `new` operator creates an instance of an object
  * `instance` is an object create from a class
  * `extends` includes another class's properties and methods
  * `constructor()` is used to create properties when creating a class
  * `methods` || `behavoirs` are functions defiend within a class
  * `super()` access and call functions on an object's parent

## React Class Components
  * Previous versions of React only allowed Functional components to render components. Therefor; Classes were used to provide state and useEffects
  * Current version of React allows for Hooks, States and useEffects, therefore has become more popular way to create components
  * React classes use `{this.props}` instead of `{props}` to access data
  * lifecycles are used instead of hooks for class based components
