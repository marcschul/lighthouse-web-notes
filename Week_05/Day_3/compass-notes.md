*August 18th, 2021*
## General
  * You can nest callbacks inside callbacks
  * `npx` is a more modern way of running installed packages like mocha
    * eg. `npx mocha`
  ### API - Application Program Interface
  * A web API is an interface with URLs as the controls. - You try to access a URL in your browser (also known as a request), and a web server somewhere makes a bunch of complicated decisions based on that and sends you back some content (also known as a response). A standard web API works the same way.
  * set of requirements that govern how one application can talk to another. 
  * allows systems to work together
  * leverage the functionality of external services
    * double edge sword if your application relies on the API as the API can become deprecated.
  * Rest API - Representational State Transfer
    * Call from client to server and get data back over the http protocol
  * Examples:
    * Yelp, for instance, displays nearby restaurants on a Google Map in its app
    * some video games now let players chat, post high scores and invite friends to play via Facebook, right there in the middle of a game.
    * Facebook users undoubtedly appreciate the ability to sign into many apps and Web sites using their Facebook IDâ€”a feature that relies upon Facebook APIs to work.
