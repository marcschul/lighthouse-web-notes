## Data Structures
  * means of organizing and storing data
  * perform operations on the stored data more efficiently.
  * Eg. Arrays, Objects, Trees
## Trees
  * Trees have `nodes`, which represent each entity of data
  * `nodes` have relationships which are called `edges`
  * The `node` at the top of the tree is called the `root node`
  * the `nodes` at the bottom of the tree are called `leaf nodes`
  * Every `node` except for the `root node` has a `single parent node`. Every `node` that is not a `leaf node` has 1 or more `children nodes`
  * All children with the same parent are siblings
  * DOM is a tree data structure
