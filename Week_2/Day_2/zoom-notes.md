  * Primitive vs Non-Primitive Data Types
    * Primitive data types
      * Immutable (cannot be altered)
      * Can be re-assigned or replaced with new value
      * Existing value cannot be changed
      * Stored by value in memory
      * Copied by their value
    * Non-primitive
      * Are mutable (can be altered)
      * Can be directly altered
      * Existing value can be changed
      * Are stored by reference in memory
      * Are copied by their reference
      * Address of that memory is stored in the variable
  * Variables
    * Declaring a variable, you are creating a new address in memory for storage
    * Google style guide suggest to use Const whenever possible, and let when required.
