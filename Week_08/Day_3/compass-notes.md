## CSS
### Colors
  * `rgb(0,0,0)` - RGB
  * `#000000` - hex
  * `#000` - shorthex
  * Hex is a value of RGB. Each double digit hex controls the brightness of the RGB Values, producing all available colours on your monitor
    * `#FF0000` - Red
    * `#00FF00` - Green
    * `#0000FF` - Blue
### Specificity
  * Specificity determines, which CSS rule is applied by the browsers.
  * Specificity is usually the reason why your CSS-rules donâ€™t apply to some elements
  * Every selector has its place in the specificity hierarchy.
  * If two selectors apply to the same element, the one with higher specificity wins.
  * Four distinct categories which define the specificity level of a given selector.
    1. Inline styles 
    2. IDs classes
    3. Attributes
    4. Elements.
